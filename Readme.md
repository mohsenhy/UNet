# U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Image Segmentation

## Introduction
U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed for biomedical image segmentation. It was introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in their 2015 paper. U-Net is designed to work with fewer training samples but still achieve precise segmentation, which is crucial in medical imaging.
## Architecture Overview
U-Net's architecture features a symmetric structure with a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder). 

- **Contracting Path**: Captures context through a series of convolutional and max pooling layers, reducing spatial dimensions.
- **Expansive Path**: Enables precise localization using up-convolutions and concatenations with high-resolution features from the contracting path.
## Key Features
- **Skip Connections**: The architecture includes skip connections from the contracting path to the expansive path, improving feature propagation and enabling more precise localization.
- **Fewer Training Samples**: U-Net is effective even with a limited number of training images, a common scenario in medical image analysis.
## Applications
Initially designed for biomedical image segmentation, U-Net has broad applications in:
- Medical image analysis (e.g., tumor segmentation).
- Satellite image processing.
- Any task requiring precise segmentation with limited data.
